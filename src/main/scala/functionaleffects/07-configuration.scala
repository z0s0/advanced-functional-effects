/**
 * ZIO's runtime system is responsible for executing effects on fibers.
 * It is one of the darkest parts of ZIO, which users seldom need to see,
 * and which some users never even know exists. However, understanding
 * the runtime system, and being able to tweak it, is the key to
 * unlocking more advanced ZIO integrations and customizing ZIO for the
 * needs of well-established applications.
 *
 * In this section, you will explore the runtime system and how to configure
 * ZIO to meet the specialized needs that more complex applications possess.

         * ZIO does not attempt to continue executing in the presence of them.
         * Rather, it calls a special handler for fatal errors, which would
         * typically log them as quickly as possible without allocating memory
         * (since one class of fatal error is out of memory exception). Doing
         * anything too extravagant would result in yet another fatal error,

         * essential to help diagnosing such fatal errors.

         * Ordinarily, you don't have to worry about fatal errors, since by
         * default, ZIO considers subtypes of VirtualMachineError to be fatal.

         * In fact, some applications may wish to consider any errors fatal,
         * if they are trying to strictly enforce the maxim that no pure code
         * should raise exceptions. To facilitate these behaviors, you can
         * override the `isFatal` field of runtime configuration.
